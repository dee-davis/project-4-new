## Approach Taken

To accomplish this project, it was important to define what this app would look like and the basic functionality and features of the app.  The idea was to build a job board web application for users.  In order to plan out the content and navigation aspects of the app, a basic wireframe was necessary to focus on the information and structural design.  A site diagram assisted in understanding the folder structure and file location for the job board app.  The trello board was used to organize tasks, keep track of everything, and provide clarity on each sprint that needed to be done.




## Future goals / unsolved features:

* Include Twitter API
* Ability for users to comment on other job posts
* Incorporate social sign-in and integration
* Ability to connect with other users in groups based on interests
* Add more functionality to the Admin model
